# Convert WordPress to epub

This child theme of the Tortuga theme uses [wp-epub-converter](https://github.com/henrikor/wp-epub-converter) plugin to create e-pub. It puts link to epub in div.entry-meta (with links to date, "Leave comment" etc.). This child also filter frontpage, so only post from category 19 will show up here.
